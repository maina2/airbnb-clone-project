Team Roles
The following roles are critical to the success of the Airbnb Clone Project, each contributing specialized skills to ensure a cohesive and functional application:

Backend Developer: Designs and implements the server-side logic, APIs, and integrations using frameworks like Django and GraphQL. They ensure the application is scalable, secure, and performs efficiently while collaborating with frontend developers and database administrators.

Database Administrator: Manages the MySQL database, designing schemas, optimizing queries, and ensuring data integrity and security. They work closely with backend developers to support efficient data storage and retrieval.

Frontend Developer: Builds the user interface and client-side functionality, ensuring a responsive and intuitive experience. They integrate with backend APIs and focus on usability and performance.

DevOps Engineer: Sets up and manages CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker. They ensure smooth deployment, monitor application performance, and maintain infrastructure scalability and reliability.

Security Specialist: Implements security measures for APIs, databases, and the overall application. They conduct vulnerability assessments, enforce secure coding practices, and ensure compliance with best practices.

Project Manager: Oversees the project timeline, coordinates tasks among team members, and ensures effective communication. They manage the GitHub repository, track progress, and ensure the project aligns with its objectives.


Technology Stack
The Airbnb Clone Project leverages a modern technology stack to build a robust and scalable booking platform. Below are the key technologies and their purposes:

Django: A Python-based web framework used for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic, enabling rapid development and secure backend functionality.
MySQL: A relational database management system used for storing and managing application data, such as user profiles, bookings, and property listings, with optimized schemas for performance.
GraphQL: An API query language used for flexible and efficient data retrieval, allowing the frontend to request only the necessary data from the backend.
Docker: A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent development and deployment environments.
GitHub Actions: A CI/CD tool used to automate testing, building, and deployment workflows, streamlining the development pipeline and ensuring code quality.
