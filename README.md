Technology Stack
The Airbnb Clone Project leverages a modern technology stack to build a robust and scalable booking platform. Below are the key technologies and their purposes:

Django: A Python-based web framework used for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic, enabling rapid development and secure backend functionality.
MySQL: A relational database management system used for storing and managing application data, such as user profiles, bookings, and property listings, with optimized schemas for performance.
GraphQL: An API query language used for flexible and efficient data retrieval, allowing the frontend to request only the necessary data from the backend.
Docker: A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent development and deployment environments.
GitHub Actions: A CI/CD tool used to automate testing, building, and deployment workflows, streamlining the development pipeline and ensuring code quality.

Database Design
The database for the Airbnb Clone Project is structured around key entities that represent the core components of the booking platform. Below are the primary entities, their important fields, and their relationships.
Entities and Fields

Users

user_id: Unique identifier for each user (Primary Key).
email: User's email address for login and communication.
name: User's full name for profile display.
password_hash: Securely hashed password for authentication.
role: Indicates whether the user is a host, guest, or both.


Properties

property_id: Unique identifier for each property (Primary Key).
host_id: References the user who owns the property (Foreign Key to Users).
title: Name or title of the property listing.
location: Address or coordinates of the property.
price_per_night: Cost of renting the property per night.


Bookings

booking_id: Unique identifier for each booking (Primary Key).
property_id: References the booked property (Foreign Key to Properties).
guest_id: References the user making the booking (Foreign Key to Users).
check_in_date: Start date of the booking.
check_out_date: End date of the booking.


Reviews

review_id: Unique identifier for each review (Primary Key).
property_id: References the reviewed property (Foreign Key to Properties).
guest_id: References the user who wrote the review (Foreign Key to Users).
rating: Numerical score (e.g., 1-5) for the property.
comment: Text description of the guest's experience.


Payments

payment_id: Unique identifier for each payment (Primary Key).
booking_id: References the associated booking (Foreign Key to Bookings).
amount: Total payment amount.
payment_date: Date the payment was processed.
status: Indicates whether the payment is completed, pending, or failed.



Entity Relationships

Users and Properties: A user (host) can own multiple properties, but each property is owned by exactly one user (one-to-many relationship).
Properties and Bookings: A property can have multiple bookings, but each booking is associated with exactly one property (one-to-many relationship).
Users and Bookings: A user (guest) can make multiple bookings, but each booking is made by exactly one user (one-to-many relationship).
Properties and Reviews: A property can have multiple reviews, but each review is associated with exactly one property (one-to-many relationship).
Users and Reviews: A user (guest) can write multiple reviews, but each review is written by exactly one user (one-to-many relationship).
Bookings and Payments: A booking can have one payment, and each payment is associated with exactly one booking (one-to-one relationship).

Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone Project includes several core features that replicate the functionality of a booking platform. Each feature is designed to enhance user experience and ensure a seamless, secure, and efficient system.

User Management: Enables registration, authentication, and profile management for hosts and guests. It ensures secure user interactions and role-based access to hosting or booking functionalities.

Property Management: Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings, including details like location, price, and availability. This feature drives the core inventory of the platform, enabling guests to browse and select accommodations.

Booking System: Facilitates the creation and management of bookings, including date selection and availability checks. It connects guests with properties and ensures accurate scheduling and confirmation processes.

Review System: Enables guests to submit ratings and comments for properties after their stay. This feature builds trust and transparency by providing feedback for future guests and hosts.

Payment Processing: Handles secure payment transactions for bookings, including processing and status tracking. It ensures financial interactions are safe and reliable, integrating with the booking system for seamless operation.


API Security
Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect sensitive data and ensure the integrity of the Airbnb Clone Project. The following key security measures will be implemented:

Authentication: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify user identity for each API request. This is crucial for protecting user data by ensuring only authenticated users can access their profiles, bookings, or property listings.

Authorization: Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict API endpoints based on user roles (e.g., host, guest). This ensures hosts can only manage their own properties and guests can only view or book available listings, safeguarding user privacy and system integrity.

Rate Limiting: Caps the number of API requests per user within a time frame to prevent abuse or denial-of-service attacks. This protects the platformâ€™s performance and availability, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.

Data Encryption: Employs HTTPS and encrypts sensitive data (e.g., payment details) both in transit and at rest. This is vital for securing payments and user information, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining trust in the platform.

Input Validation and Sanitization: Validates and sanitizes all API inputs to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). This protects the database and application from malicious inputs, ensuring robust security across all features.
